# 🚀 EPSIONYX – AI-Powered Career & Learning Ecosystem

EPSIONYX is a full-stack AI-powered ecosystem that guides students from **high school to university to meaningful careers** — and even helps create **entirely new roles** in an evolving AI-driven economy.

This project was built as a solo submission for the [Hack United 2025](https://unitedhacks.tech) hackathon.

> “Built from heartbreak — rebuilt to help others dream forward.”

## 🌟 Why EPSIONYX?

Too many students are forced to choose degrees and careers without real guidance. EPSIONYX bridges that gap by providing:

- 🎓 **University & Career Path Recommendations**
- 🧠 **Course Difficulty Prediction**
- 🔁 **Daily Industry Tasks Based on Syllabus**
- 💼 **Pre-Graduation Skill Building**
- 🗺️ **End-to-End Academic & Career Navigation**

## 🧠 Inspiration

My personal journey inspired EPSIONYX:

Despite being a top high school student (91% Math, 90% Physics), I chased medicine — not because I loved it, but because it was the only “success” path I knew. I switched degrees 3 times, lost my bursary, my mom lost her house trying to keep me in school, and I still couldn’t graduate.

In 2024–2025, I joined a full-stack bootcamp and discovered my love for coding.

EPSIONYX is what I **wish I had** — now I’m building it for students like me.
